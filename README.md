# Human Face Detection

A real-time human face detection project that utilizes deep learning models for accurate and efficient detection of multiple faces in a frame. This repository provides code and resources for setting up a face detection system using Python and OpenCV.

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Processes live video feed for immediate face detection.
- **Multi-Face Recognition**: Capable of detecting multiple faces in a single frame.
- **High Accuracy**: Optimized for diverse conditions, handling various lighting and background scenarios.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple setup and modular code for easy integration into other projects.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**: For image and video processing.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Options include YOLO, Haar Cascades, or DNN-based methods.
